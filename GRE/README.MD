We have alternating Quant and Verbal Sections after the essay section

Out of these either one Quant or one Verbal Section is unmarked (called as Experimental section) but the candidate will never get to know which one!

So effectively our GRE can be broken down into a series of 7 tests we have to take one after the other.

# Quant Section:


# Verbal Section:

## Foundation:

At the core of understanding Verbal Section questions lies one's strength i:
- English Grammar [A lot of us especially non-native speakers who have spent 12+ years of education in an institution where the primary language of instruction might be English and we assume that we have all it takes to ignore this. Well, it might be true for some peoplw but not the majority.]
- Vocabulary! [The epitaph for the verbal scores!. Non-Native speakers need to beat this giant till the extent required. Non-native speakers need to learn to extend their interpretations beyond the common ones]


# Writing Section:
