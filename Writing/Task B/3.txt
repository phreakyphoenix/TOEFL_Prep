The completion of assignments are an important part one's academic career. The usage of computers and internet can be treated option for making the process smooth and easier with its downsides. I believe that the option of having computer and internet connective is definitely are a great aid in for completing assignments faster as well as making the process simply. This because of the a few reasons like the access of vast amount of information one can refer, usage of discussion forums for clearing doubts and getting feedback and additional tools to understand the problems better.

Computers along with internet connectivity make it a lot easier for us to access a vast amount of information related to our assignment. In the earlier days, one was limited by the resources one could avail and had to work within constrained environments. However, the situation has changes nowadays. A student who might be given a case study on the French Revolution as an assignment can refer multiple sources to formulate his or her report. Additionally, the student gets to learn from other's work in the similar scenarios and upskills himself or herself without being limited by a narrow perspective. Furthermore, there is a lot of information available on the internet for free and with the reduction in internet charges it has been possible to eliminate economic hurdles to access of quality information

In addition to the vast of information one can refer to, online discussion forums provide great assistance to a student when he or she might hit a roadblock while carrying out the assignments. Previously, a lot of time was spent by students in rectifying mistakes or even clarifying doubts on their own since mentors were not easily available. In contrast, today the computers with an internet access helps anyone to post their queries and get them answers very easily and quickly. This tends to save a lot of useful time. Moreover, students get to learn from other's mistakes as well since such forums have a collection of queries posted over time. The ability of getting to know people who share a common interest while the student is looking for solutions is a complementary benefit.

Lastly, the computer and the internet access provides a lot of tools a student can use to better understand the problems they are solving. Usually students used to learn from their professor's lectures or the books they read and tackled a problem using the knowledge they grasped. However, at times this turned out to quite monotonous, cumbersome as well as limiting the student's ability to understand the actual significance of the problems or the essence behind the solutions of the same. With the internet these same students can make use of multiple software or practical walkthroughs to understand the problem they are solving in greater depths. For example, using Google Earth for a Geography assignment on writing a report on distribution of volcanoes provide a clearer understanding in addition to the information provided by academic texts.

In conclusion, I believe that the usage of internet and computers is boon to the students for completing their assignments. Not only does the benefits of access to vast amount of information, discussion forums and tools to assist learning concepts make it easier for them to carry out the tasks but also help in saving a lot of time that the students can use in some other productive scenario

Computers and the internet have made some aspects of school assignments faster and easier.
But school assignments have also changed in order to adjust to the speed at which students can access information. 
So is it really any easier now to complete these assignments?

When I was a child, completing a report on a foreign country meant heading to the library, pulling out a kid’s encyclopedia and photocopying the relevant pages.
First, I would just copy pieces of this onto my page and turn in my report. 
Eventually I started rewriting, but I relied on long quotations from my research, and finally I learned to rewrite information in my own words.
All of this took a long time, especially when I had to rewrite something because I changed my mind about what I wanted to say or because I found some new information in a different book.

My first thought about the effect of the intenet on such assignments was to assume that plagiarism has only increased.
It’s so much easier now to just copy and paste material from some source you find online.
And that would definitely make it easier to complete the assignment!
However, I know that there are now tools that teachers can use to check for plagiarism and, more importantly, teachers have no doubt increased the expectations of such assignments.

Or, perhaps teachers are assigning different kinds of tasks in the first place.
For example, instead of asking students  to develop their own ideas, theteacher might ask them to develop a website that organizes the ideas of others.
In a sense, this kind of assignment is closer to what students might have to do at a real job in the real world.

As you can see above, I’m torn about this question: on the one hand, students can grab information faster, can edit faster, and can more easily apply professional formatting. But it’s
probably the case that the nature
of such assignments have changed.
Perhaps this seemingly unlimited access to information has led teachers to rethink what they assign, so that the focus is more on analysis of information, not just finding the information.
After all, now it’s very easy to gather a large pool of research. 
The challenging part is making sense of it all
