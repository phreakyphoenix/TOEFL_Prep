# My Resonse:

In today's world, taking decisions related to one's career is a very crucial part of one's life. Some people tend to rely on themselves completely for making these choices while others prefer to have a mentor to advise them regarding this. I would prefer to have a mentor for advising me for my career rather than being solely dependent on my own efforts for a few reasons like learning from experience of a mentor helps in making our path to achieve our goals easier, getting valuable feedback on our decisions and mistakes helps us improve and lastly the mere availability of a mentor for clearing one doubts helps in increasing the pace of one's learning as well as getting one out of any dilemma very quickly.

First, a mentor has a lot experience to share with his or her pupils and this proves to be a valuable asset in one's career. For example, when I was in sophomore year I was looking forward to start my career in academic research related to Machine Learning. Initially, I was puzzled by the various areas of research one could pursue and got intimidated soon. However, with my mentor's advise and learning about her own experience in working with biomedical applications over the years eventually paved the path towards my first research paper within next 4 months and made my focus laser sharp.

In addition to the vast experience a mentor has to offer, getting feedback from a mentor for one's work can be very crucial to the overall development as well as early identification of faults. At times, it might happen that if we are working as per own set schedule and ourselves determining if we met the requirements of our goal, we might be blinded by some minor setbacks in the process which would harm our progress in the long term. I had a coach in my high school who played a pivotal role in my weight loss journey. I had the opinion that performing long hours of cardiovascular training would help me reduce weight easily. Although in the initial weeks, I noticed some improvements but later on the there was zero progress. I used to feel that as I am increasing my stamina I am reaching more closer to my goals. However when my coach pointed out that in spite of my hard work over the weeks I am still behind my targets due the fact that I was having junk food as a major part of my diet and his advice to switch to healthier options along with a weight training schedule helped me to realize my goals a lot faster.

Furthermore, the benefits of having a mentor to advise one self extends to crucial scenarios where one is in a dilemma between certain choices and eventually gets demotivated or suffers from stress due the inability of making a firm decision. Additionally, we counter certain periods in our career when we get stuck due to some sudden roadblocks and it takes us a lot of time to get back on track. When I was preparing for my masters applications I was confused between the program I should opt for since I had been an active problem solver on the famous Data Science platform Kaggle as well as been presenting my research work under my supervisor in multiple conferences. My class advisor came to my rescue and counselled me that eventually led to my realization that I wanted to solve more problems that effect the healthcare industry but at the same time had a deep desire to explore and craft the mathematics behind it. Had it not been for my class advisor, I would have been lost in the process of deciding the type of program I should choose and therefore wasted a lot of weeks in deciding my graduate schools.

Therefore, I firmly believe that the choice of having a mentor to advise one is always a better option rather than being completely dependent on oneself. The benefits provided by mentor by sharing his or her experience, providing feedback, clearing doubts serves to be an asset towards one's success in fulfillment one's career goals. Moreover, these reasons also consolidate to serve as a source of motivate for one to continuously strive to get what one desires.

# Sample Response:

I think it is better to have a mentor to advise you in your career than try and rely entirely on yourself.
They can save you from greivous mistakes in what you study and how to get started in that career.
For example if you were visiting a foreign country, you would buy a guide book and learn about the place you go and what you can do there.
You should also do that with a career. 
It is also hard to rely on yourself to pursue a career. Look at the statistics for university students.
Most people who have parents and grandparents who went to university will also go to university. 
The same is not true for people whos parents did not go to university. 
Without that experience to follow, it is hard to be the first.

Relying on yourself is also more difficult because of the Internet.
If you donâ€™t have a mentor but use information on the computer youare also relying on someone elses expereince. 
This person is not writing to you but that is still advice and you do not know what you can trust of what you read.
Some of the information may be wrong. 
A good mentor can help you decide what is correct. 
You may not know the things that happen in the career when you are older that you will not like. 
You do not know about them at the beginning but a mentor know about those things because they are having a longer career so they cantell you what to do.

In many countries, businesses are passed from father to son and daughter and this is because those families know that it is important 
to have that experienced advise to continue the success of that business for many generations.
Even after the son is brought in, the father will stay on to advise and many family members also help governance. 
This is like a mentor even though it is the family giving the advise.

The best reason to have a mentor is that they can introduce you to other people who have that career and may even be someone who can be your boss.
Good mentors often have successful companies and they may hire you and bring you into the company.

For these reasons it is better to have a mentor for a career than to rely on yourself.
