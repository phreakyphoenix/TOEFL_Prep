# Question:

"Loyalty is the most important quality in choosing a friend." Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

# My response:
The quote, "A man is known by the company he keeps" forms the basis of an important issue we face in today's world, i.e. choosing our friends. Loyalty turns out to be a major factor for many people in deciding their friends. In my opinion, the choice of one's friends based upon their loyalty to one is indeed important due to the reasons that people differ in opinions but being loyal towards each other makes their bond stronger and the fact that  trust is inspired by loyalty.

It is reasonable to accept the fact that most people are not similar and differ in their opinions about different things. Thus, the chances of disagreements in  a discussions are always high. However, frequent disagreements among peers can lead to an eventual gap between the understanding of each other's decisions and further result in loss of respect for one another. Thus, if one is loyal to someone, they tend to respect the other person's views in spite of having a difference. This mutual acceptance strengthens the bond of friendship in the long term and helps avoid any unruly fights.

In addition to the acceptance of each other's opinions, loyalty inspires trust. People often form opinions about each other due to personal experiences or being motivated by external reasons such as the the person's previous acts, conduct with others, success or failures. These opinions can lead to the formation of doubt in one's mind for one's friend or companion. The advent of doubt can quickly give rise to severe trust issues and drive a wedge in the relationship. Although, the foundation of the problems are usually concrete but the consequences can result in difficulties in cherishing each other's company. One's constant fear of being a victim due to the other's conduct or mishap in a different scenario always seems to drive a wedge in the relationship. Thus, the factor of loyalty plays a crucial role to evade this and reinstate one's trust in his or her companion despite the several reasons that might be floating around for not to do so.

Therefore, I would like to conclude that loyalty is the most important quality in choosing a friend one should sought for. The mutual respect for one another and the feeling of trust instilled by loyalty strongly affirms my belief.

# Sample Response:

I do not believe loyalty is the most
important quality when it comes to
choosing a friend. When I think of
the single most important attribute
I want a friend to have, it would be
honesty.

I need to be able to trust my friends and I need to believe that they’re going to be honest with me. 
That honesty includes telling me when I’m wrong.
If I make a mistake, or if I’m making choices that my friends don’t agree with, I need to know that they’re going to be honest and bring it up to me.
I want my friends to challenge me and make me better, and if they’re too worried about appearing “disloyal” to do that, then I don’t think the friendhsip is very healthy.
If my friends aren’t blindly loyal to me than their support is all the more meaningful. 
It means they critically looked at my actions and have chosen to stand behind me rather than telling me I’m right just because we’re friends. 
It makes their support more valid.

I also believe that people need to fight their own battles. 
Say, for example, my best friend and I have a third friend in common who I’m not too fond of. 
If loyalty were the most important thing to me, I may try to sway my best friend to also start dislking the third friend or even stop associating with them. 
I don’t think that’s a fair thing to ask a friend to do, but I’ve certainly seen that type of control in different real life friendships. 
I think sometimes loyalty can lead toa sort situation where people can stop thinking for themselves and start acting as a unit and while I think it’s important to have a sense of community, you also want to keep your individuality. 
If everyone thought the same we would never learn from one another, and I think one of the greatest gifts of friendship is exposing each other to new things and ideas.

I don’t want my friends to be loyal to me just because that’s what they think friendship is.
I want them to choose to be loyal when they are truly moved to do so and I want to be able to trust them enough to honestly express themselves and tell me when they think I’m wrong.
I certainly would have enough respect for them and the friendship to do the same.

- Did'nt spend much time on the topic so could not disagree more 
- Misinterpreted to a great degree
- Personal examples are missing. Too much philosophical dumping
