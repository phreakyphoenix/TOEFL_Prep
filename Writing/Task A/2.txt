# My Response:

The article tell us about the economic feasibility of new mass transport system called as ProjectX and it potential to revolutionize human transportation. The author gives three reasons of support. The professor explains that a system like ProjectX is highly impractical for replacing other existent transportation mediums as well as not economically feasible. She refutes each of the author's points.

First, the passage states that the new transportation system is a great substitute for modern modes of transportations such as cars and aero planes since it could help in the reduction in carbon emissions and burning of fossil fuels since it only runs on electric power. The professor refutes this point by saying that since the system is solely dependent on electric power there could be major blockage in case of any power cut. Furthermore, this could even lead to people getting stuck in disastrous situations since it would underground.

Second, the article claims that the system would reduce the number of overall accidents and therefore make travelling much more safer. The professor opposes this point by explaining that since the system in underground it is more prone to terrorist attacks as compared to air travel. Moreover, in case of an accident a great chunk of the route could be affected that would hault other passenger's journeys as well

Third, the reading posits that the system would help in raising a substantial amount of revenue for the state of California as well as the companies involved in building it. The professor explains that since the system works in a sensitive environment like near-vacuum state, it is highly susceptible to damage due to dirt, moisture, etc. Thus the cost of maintenance in addition to the initial cost of development would not make the system an economically feasible option.  

# Difficulties:

- Spellings improved
- Connecting passage with listening
- Template Formation
- Examples of points 
- Point 1 (Accidents..loads of shit missed out)
- Point 2 (Additional info about electicity cut)
- Point 3 ( Ignored Gut Feeling about feasibility. Details not to the point about maintainence)

# Sample Response

The lecturer is not confident that the Project X will be as much of a transportation breakthrough that the passage describes. 

First, the lecturer explains that the system would have to perform almost perfectly in order to be safer and less expensive than other transportation options.
Since the travel occurs in an enclosed system, there can literally be zero accidents or else it is possible thewhole tunnel could be destroyed. 
If one plane is grounded, other planes can still fly. 
However, if a pod is involved in an accident, other pods couldnâ€™t travel. 
This would make each accident very expensive because the whole system could shut down

The lecturer is clearly skeptical about how the system is powered, too. 
Because Project X would run on electricity, what would happen if the power fails?
People trapped in an undergrund pod would have to be rescued. 
Power failures do happen and would definitely impact the safety and cost of Project X.

The lecturers final complaint about Project X is the unproven technology. 
The lecturer asserts that the technology is almost completely untested.
It should work from a theoretical perspective, but nobody knows whether it actually will. 
Nothing exists that is similar to Project X.
So the cost estimates might be completely wrong and the system might be much more expensive to build and maintain than expected.
