# My Response

The article states that the practice of keeping wild animals in a captive environments inside zoos rather than their natural habitats has a detrimental effect on their overall welfare. The author gives three points of support. The professor explains that despite certain shortcoming of keeping wild animals in zoos, the criticism on the ill effects that result from the practice are not harsh as zoos provided a lot benefits and assist in the crucial process of conservation of endangered animal species as well as safeguarding animals from other threats. The professor refutes each of the points given by the author.

First, the reading claims that zoos are incapable of simulating the vast area encompassed by the natural habitat of an animal and living is constrained environments can result in the animals' exhibition of self destructive behaviors or refusal to mate. The professor opposes this point by saying that the amount of space allocated for the animals and resemblance to the natural habitat is not an issue in developed countries like Singapore where the size of the zoo is so enormous that tourists at times complain that they were not able to see all the animals. Moreover such zoos have habitats to suit the needs of the animals. 

Second, the article posits that the simulation of a natural habitat of a species is a very complex process that involves a lot of components including weather, food resources, etch which zoos fail to replicate completely. The professor refutes this point by explaining that the natural habitat of an animal is not always a safe place for its survival. In zoos the animals are saved from threats of deforestation and climate change and hence can be prevented from extinction

Third, the passage tells that the practice of zoos to use the public for interacting with animals in exchange of raising funds can have severe ill effects over the animals' welfare. There have been instances where visitors have deliberately tried to taunt or harm the animals out of joy. In a particular scenario, a innocent gorilla had to killed to save the life of child who fell into its' enclosure. The professor explains that although interactions between zoo visitors and animals have been tragic at times, considering it as a core reason to stop having zoos in unreasonable. Instead, we should focus on using technology and education in avoiding such problems. We learn that if the wall of the enclosure was higher, the child would never have fallen and thus the need of killing the innocent gorilla would have never arisen. Furthermore if people are educated about how to behave in front of animals as well as the their significance to our ecosystem, we could possible avoid all such instances of misconduct by visitors with zoo animals

# Sample Response:

The lecturer address claims from the passage that zoos treat animals unfairly by placing them in an unatural environment.

The passage also claims that interactions with humans result in harm to the animals. 

The lecturer argues that animals have access to natural habitats in a zoo and that negative interactions could be significantly decreased.
The passage discusses problems with placing zoo animals in anunnatural environment.
For example, animals that are crammed into a smaller space than natural can cause them to become depressed and aggressive.
But the lecturer points out that most good zoos take care as much as possible to match the natural habitat of the animals. 
The lecturer also highlights the fact that some animals are at far more less risk in a zoo than in the wild.

While the author of the passage is concerned about interactions with humans that result in harm to animals, the lecturer counters with an
argument that most of these rare unhappy events could be prevented with more attention to technology.

The passage mentions an example where a gorilla was killed to prevent it hurting a child who crawled into the gorilla’s pen.
The lecturer believes that this type of incident could be prevented with higher fences or other measures.

The lecturer is adament that the pros associated with zoos—conservation, research, education —far outweighs the cons pointed
out in the passage
